INTRODUCTION

The pourpose of this document:

This document explains the various test activities that I performed as part of the manual and in some part automation testing of the „olx.ba“ website. In this test 
session I'll test Registration, Login and Products publishing flows as how those sections should behave to provide the best user experience. Because olx.ba has a 
large number of categories and subcategories that part of the site won't be tested in detail and I will showcase a simple automatin script of Product publishing flow. 

Application Overview:

Olx.ba is an e-commerce website where users can buy and sell physical goods, services and digital products. Users can create „OLX Classic“ profil with basic features 
or „OLX Shop“ profile with more professional based features. The OLX.ba site is the first and largest BiH e-commerce site based on the principle of social network, 
whose primary goal is to unite buyers and sellers in one place. The site is designeg in such a way that, in addition to it's primary service – sales and purchases – 
- it provides it's visitors with an insight into the state of the BH market, regardless of the type of item or the branch of interest. OLX.ba has more than 3,250,343 
users, 3,092 active OLX shops and 4,303,869 activi items in 2187 categories. 

Testing Scope:

For this test cycle I will test a smaller number of modules that are important for good user experience. 

In-Scope:

-	Registration Flow 
-	Login Flow
-	Product Publishing Flow

Out-Scope: 

-	Non Functional testing wasn't done for this website.
